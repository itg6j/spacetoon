I'm pleased to share my Spacetoon Program project with you, a comprehensive accounting program developed in Java for use with the terminal.

Program Features:

Inventory Management: Easily add, modify, and delete merchandise

Invoicing: Directly issue purchase and sales invoices

Supplier and Customer Management: Track farmers, buyers, and suppliers

Daily Sales and Purchase Tracking
Data Storage using text files

How I Built It:

Simple and interactive terminal interface
Modularized program for each task
Error handling and input validation to ensure data accuracy
This project combines practical programming with everyday accounting applications and can be further developed into a more integrated system in the future.
